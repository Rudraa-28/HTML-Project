	<li><h3>PAN PIZZA (£5)</h3>
		<img src="images\panpizza.gif" alt="Picture of a pizza" width="200" height="150">
	
	<ul>
		<li> A metal pizza tray is ideal for cooking thick pizza bases as it has a perforated base to allow heat to penetrate and crisp the base of the pizza. Turn this into a supreme pizza by adding ham, reduced-fat salami and black olives.Preheat oven to 220C/200C fan-forced. Spray a 30cm (base) pizza tray (see note) with oil to lightly grease. Punch down centre of dough with your fist. Press dough out over prepared pan.Spread dough evenly with pizza sauce. Sprinkle with half the cheese. Top with capsicum , mushroom , pineapple and remaining cheese. Arrange tomatoes on top. Bake for 25 minutes or until crust is golden and tomatoes have softened. Serve.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>STUFFED CRUST PIZZA (3£)</h3>
	<img src="images\.jpg" alt="Picture of a pizza 2" width="130" height="130">
	
	
	<ul>
	<li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the crust. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Layer vegetables over the cheese. Then, sprinkle the Simply Organic herbs over the veggies. But instead of typical pizza toppings like onion, peppers, and olives, we're going with fresh basil pesto and thinly sliced, creamy, Yukon gold potato. Place the pizza on the baking sheet. Bake the pizza for 20 min until the crust is golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>HAND TOSSED PIZZA (5£)</h3>
	<img src="images\handtoss.jpg" alt="Picture of a pizza 3" width="200" height="175">
	
	<ul>
	<li>The Hand Tossed pizza crust is thinner than the Handmade Pan, but thicker than the Crunchy Thin. Hand Tossed crust dough is stretched to your preferred size. Once we bake the pizza, this crust is accented with a garlic—oil season blend.When preparing a hand-tossed pizza, we knead the dough until it is soft. After kneading, the dough is repeatedly tossed in the air till it gets the perfect shape.The hand-tossed pizza will be your perfect delicacy if you want a thin pie with less oil and fewer toppings.  </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><h3>THIN CRUST PIZZA (3£)</h3>
	     <img src="images\thincrust.gif" alt="Picture of a pizza 4" width="200" height="150">
	<ul>
	<li>This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2 cm).a thin layer of dough which is stretched into an oiled, square "Sicilian" pan, topped sparingly with shredded mozzarella, crushed uncooked canned tomatoes, chopped garlic and olive oil, and baked until the top bubbles and the bottom is crisp. The pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. In pizzerias, pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><h3>THE BIG-FOOT PIZZA (9£)</h3>
	     <img src="images\bigfoot.jpg" alt="Picture of a pizza 5" width="200" height="150">
	<ul>
	<li> Roll out crusts on a lightly floured surface until they are slightly larger than half of the baking pan. Work the pizza crusts into the baking pan, making sure the dough goes up the sides and covers the entire pan. Pinch the dough seam together in the middle to meld the 2 crusts into a big 1. Drizzle the crust with remaining olive oil and poke the crust with a fork a few times. Par-bake crust in the oven for 6 minutes.
	Remove pan from oven and use a fork to push down any bubbles that have formed in the crust. Spread marinara sauce evenly over crust, working it all the way to the edges. Then spread on cheese, pepperoni, green peppers, and dried basil. Return pizza to oven and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking, until dough is nicely browned around the edges and cheese is bubbling. </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><h3>THE PRIAZZO (8£)</h3>
	     <img src="images\piazzo.jpg" alt="Picture of a pizza 6" width="200" height="150">
	<ul>
	<li>The Priazzo was deep-dish or “stuffed pizza” in style. Inspired by rustic Italian pies, they would take a pan and lay a pizza dough inside it. Then they would fill the crust with ingredients. Which ingredients depended on the variation you bought. After that, they would top it off with another layer of pizza, which they would layer with sauce and cheese. Priazzo is not a pizza. Because unlike pizza, Priazzo has a bottom and a top. And all those great toppings you usually have on your pizza come stuffed inside Priazzo. It’s covered with sauce, cheddar, and mozzarella cheese and baked to perfection. Priazzo is delicious, but it’s not pizza.</li>
