<h3><mark>ABOUT US</mark></h3>
<hr>
<P> <strong>FOOD HUB</strong> is an <em>American-based multinational fast food chain</em>, founded in 1948 as an eatry in a small town run by Mr. and Mrs. Sushi San Fransisco, United States. They started their business as a pizza stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the circular red logo which was introduced in 1967 at a location in <strong>New jersy, United states</strong>. <br>In 1955, <strong>Kroc ray (1904–1990), a businessman, </strong>joined the company as an agent and started purchasing the chain from Mr and Mrs sushi. Firstly, Food hub had its <strong>previous headquarters in New jersy, United states, but later it was moved to its global headquarters to Chicago in year 2000</strong>.</p>
<p> It has become one of the largest franchise and restaurant chain by revenue which serves over 60 million people in 30 different countries in year 2020. This franchise also helped many people who got stuck in the pandemic both financially and emotionally. Products are offered as either "dine-in" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or "take-out" (where the customer opts to take the food off the premises). <strong>Dine-in</strong> meals are provided on a <strong>plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray</strong>. "Take-out" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in an ecofriendly Food hub-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as properly.</p>
<p>The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings. That same year, Food hub began selling its own BreadBowl Pasta, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Cake dessert, composed of a chocolate sponge of cake filled with warm fudge. Food hub promoted the dessert by flying in 900 cakes to deliver at <strong>Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state</strong>.</p>
